# Dictionaries and Sets
Dictionaries and sets are powerful data structures in Python.

## Dictionaries:
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs that are unordered and mutable.

Example:
person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
print(person['name'])  # Output: Alice

## Sets:
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.

Example:
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
