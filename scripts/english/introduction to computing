We commonly define a computer as a device that accepts data as input, process it based on some set of program/instructions and eventually generate meaningful output 


Example of computers include our laptops, mobile phones and many other gadgets out there.

Now, we have input and output devices:
Input devices help us communicate with the computer by telling it what to do while output devices help the computer provide information to us the users.

Example of input devices include: Keyboard, Mouse, Touchpad, Scanner, Gamepad, Joystick etc

EXample of output devices include: Monitor/Tvs, speaker, printer, etc

Any thing you attached to the computer in this way is mostly called a peripheral device.
