Loops: For and While
Loops allow you to repeat actions, which is a key concept in programming.

For Loop: Use a for loop to iterate over a sequence of items.
for number in range(5):
    print(This is iteration number:, number)

While Loop: Use a while loop when you want to repeat an action until a condition changes.
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(Count is:, count)
    count += 1
