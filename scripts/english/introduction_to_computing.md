Introduction to Computing
Welcome to the world of computing!

A computer is not just a gadget; it’s a powerful device that takes in data,
processes it according to specific instructions, and produces meaningful output.
Think of it as a magical box that transforms your commands into action!

What Makes a Computer Work?
- Input Devices: These are our hands to the computer. They allow us to communicate what we want.
Examples include: Keyboard, Mouse, Touchpad, Scanner, Gamepad.

- Output Devices: These are the computer's voice, conveying information back to us.
Examples include: Monitor/TV, Speakers, Printer.

When we attach any device to our computer for input or output, we call it a peripheral device.
So, every time you click your mouse or print a document, you’re engaging with a network of interconnected devices working together!
