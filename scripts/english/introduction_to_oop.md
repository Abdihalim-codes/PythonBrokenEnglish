# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.

## Defining a Class:
You can define classes to encapsulate data and behavior.

Example:
class Dog:
    def bark(self):
        print('Woof!')

my_dog = Dog()
my_dog.bark()  # Output: Woof!
