Introduction to Programming
Welcome to the exciting realm of programming!

At its core, programming is the art of crafting instructions that tell a computer what to do.
These skilled individuals, known as programmers or software engineers, build the software we use every day.

A Brief History of Programming
The first programmers laid the groundwork by creating simple applications capable of performing basic arithmetic operations,
such as Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.

From these humble beginnings, programming has evolved into a powerful tool that drives everything from mobile apps
to complex artificial intelligence systems. Today, programmers create sophisticated software that impacts our lives,
enabling us to solve problems and innovate like never before!
