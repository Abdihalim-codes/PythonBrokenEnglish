# Data Structures: Lists and Tuples
Python provides versatile data structures that allow you to store and manipulate collections of data.

## Lists:
Lists are ordered collections that are mutable, meaning you can change their content.

Example:
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.append('orange')  # Adds 'orange' to the list

## Tuples:
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed.

Example:
coordinates = (10, 20)
