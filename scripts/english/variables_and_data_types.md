Variables and Data Types
In Python, variables are like containers for storing data.
They allow you to label and manipulate values in your programs.

Common Data Types:
- Integers: Whole numbers, like 5 or 100.
- Floats: Decimal numbers, like 3.14 or 2.5.
- Strings: Textual data, enclosed in quotes, like Hello, World!.
- Booleans: True or False values, used for logical operations.

Example of Variable Assignment:
name = Alice
age = 25
is_student = True
