# Introduction to APIs
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software applications to communicate.

## Making a Simple API Request:
You can use the requests library to interact with APIs.

Example:
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
print(response.json())  # Output: JSON data from the API
