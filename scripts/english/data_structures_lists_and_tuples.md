# Data Structures: Lists and Tuples
In Python, lists and tuples are essential data structures that help us store collections of items.

## Lists:
- Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content.
- They are defined using square brackets [].

Example:
my_list = [1, 2, 3, apple, banana]

## Tuples:
- Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their content cannot be changed.
- They are defined using parentheses ().

Example:
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, apple, banana)
